# Cucumber Leaf Disease Classification using LTriDP and Haralick Features

## üìä Research Impact
- **Citations**: 8
- **Unique Contribution**: First work to combine Local Tri-directional Patterns (LTriDP) and Haralick features for robust cucumber disease classification in real-world farming conditions
- **Achievement**: 96.80% accuracy in noisy, real-world conditions

## üîç Problem Statement
Plant diseases cause major economic and production losses in agriculture worldwide. In Pakistan:
- 3,426 hectares used for cucumber cultivation
- 52,766 tonnes total production
- 15.4 tonnes/hectare average yield
- Punjab contributes 82% of production

Early and accurate disease detection is crucial for:
- Preventing crop losses
- Optimizing treatment timing
- Improving farm productivity
- Maintaining food security
